JPAZ2 framework
===============

The JPAZ2 framework is an educational framework. The main objective of the framework is to support teaching Java and OOP concepts to beginners, i.e., students with no previous programming experience. The key concepts are turtle graphics, programming by extending existing classes, and visual interaction with objects in the run-time.

The next objective of the framework is to make programming of simple interactive and visual applications (e.g. simple 2D games) in Java easier. This is achieved by providing a collection of classes that hide many technical details required for creating such applications in Java (e.g. threading and synchronization, buffered images, drawing, animated objects and animations, midi music and uncompressed audio, etc.).

Methodology
-----------

The JPAZ2 framework was designed to fulfil needs of an introductionary programming course PAZ1a at P.J. Šafárik University in Košice, Slovakia and to support creativity of students attending this course. The teaching methodology based on JPAZ2 framework can be found here: http://web.ics.upjs.sk/paz1a/ (only in the slovak language) - the website contains lectures, videorecordings of lectures, slides, and excercises.
